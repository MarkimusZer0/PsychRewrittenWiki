# PsychRewrittenWiki
This is a fanmade rewrite of the official Psych Engine wiki.

This used to be a fork of Psych Engine, however it's now it's own repository.

Since ShadowMario hasn't updated the official wiki in months, I decided to rewrite it.

For problems and/or suggestions, you can make an issue on this repository, or DM me on Discord at Detective Baldi#1002.

This wiki's content is mostly stuff related to Psych Engine's Lua system, for learning things outside of that, look at the **official** Psych Engine wiki.

Please note that some variables and/or functions on this wiki haven't been implemented in the official releases of Psych Engine. Some of them can only be accessed via Psych Engine's action builds until a new update releases.

You can get Psych Engine on the Github page [here](https://github.com/ShadowMario/FNF-PsychEngine), or the Gamebanana page [here](https://gamebanana.com/mods/309789).
